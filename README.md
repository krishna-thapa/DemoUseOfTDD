# Demo Use Of TDD
Simple java based demo projects written with TDD practices 

Test-driven development (TDD) is a development technique where you must first write a test that 
fails before you write new functional code.TDD is being quickly adopted by agile software developers for development of 
application source code and is even being adopted by Agile DBAs for database development.

In this Java project, I have carried out simple Java projects that were written in TDD approach.
1. FizzBuzz 
2. Login Management
3. Count numbers of Vowels in a String
4. Reverse a given char array
